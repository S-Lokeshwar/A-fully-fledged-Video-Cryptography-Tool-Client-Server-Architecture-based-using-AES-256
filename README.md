# A-fully-fledged-Video-Cryptography-Tool-Client-Server-Architecture-based-using-AES-256
The project involves creating a secure connection between the client and the server as the server performs the Cryptography process on the confidential video file (Irrespective of the file size). AES-256 is used for the cryptography part and for secure communication part, AES-256 is used and this project satisfies CIA triad.
